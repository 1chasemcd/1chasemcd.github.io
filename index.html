          <h2>Want to learn to code?</h2>
          <p>This summer camp is meant to be a fun easy introduction to coding.
            Kids in grades 2 to 5 are recommended for the camp. Throughout the
            four days, we will be using multiple coding apps and educational
            tools that will teach your kids the fundamentals of coding. All of
            the necessary technology will be provided. At around 10:30am there
            will be a included snack. If you have any questions about the
            schedule, please don't hesitate to email us!</p>

          <h2>Chase</h2>
          <p>I am a Sophomore at Summit Highschool.  I have taken classes on
            computer science, and have made online tutorials for coding. Also, I
            have participated on Summit's robotics team where I help to build and
            learn to code this years robot. I know the programing languages java,
            python, HTML, and CSS. And I am very excited to share my passion with
            other kids.

          <h2>Claire</h2>
          <p>I am a seventh grader at Cascade middle school. Chase is my older
            brother, and he has taught me a lot about coding. When I was younger,
            I used an app called Hopscotch to learn to code. I was always proud
            when I was able to start from scratch and make a computer draw
            something, or make a stick figure move. I had lots of help from my
            older brother. With this creation of this camp, I am hopeful that
            other children will have this same experience and be able to enjoy
            coding!</p>

          <h2>Intro to Programming</h2>
          <p>In this program, students grades 2 to 5 will gain basic knowledge on
            coding. We will start by using a simple language called Blockly on
            code.org to learn about the basic tools of coding. Blockly uses
            colorful blocks of code that can be used together to create games.
            This will teach the concepts involved in all programing languages,
            while avoiding the complex syntax used in written programming
            languages like Java and Python. After kids learn the basics of
            programming, they will use their new skills to program robots such as
            spheros, Lego Mindstorms robots, and more!</p>
